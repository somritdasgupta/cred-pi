**Credπ** is a simple credit card UPI ID generator designed for easy payments. The best part? It doesn't use any backend or server-side processing! Everything happens right on your device.

## Features:

- **No Server-Side Storage**: All data you input (mobile number, credit card number) stays on your device.
- **Client-Side Only**: There’s **no server involved** at any point. This means there’s no chance of your sensitive data being sent to or stored by a server.
- **Completely Local**: The application relies on your browser’s local storage for temporarily caching your information. This ensures all data remains on your device.
- **Generate UPI IDs**: Input your credit card number and mobile number, and the app generates UPI IDs for different banks.

## How It Works:

1. Enter your mobile number and credit card number.
2. The app generates UPI IDs for several banks based on your details.
3. You can copy the UPI ID or generate a QR code for payments, or in mobile directly open the preferred UPI app with the details filled in.

## Privacy:

- Since **everything happens on your browser**, no data leaves your device.
- **No SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** means no external server processes or stores your data.
- Your mobile number and credit card details are **not transmitted** anywhere—**it all stays on your device**.

## Why Trust?

Credπ is a very simple single page codebase and has been developed just for sake of ease while paying bills. By ensuring that all data is stored locally in your browser cache and these's no concept of server in here, you can stay ensured that nothing leaves you local device.
